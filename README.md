# 👋 Hi, I'm Svetoslav Kamenov! 🌟

🚀 **Junior QA Engineer** with a passion for **automated testing**, **API testing**, and **CI/CD**. I live to break things (well, in a controlled environment, of course 😅).  
💡 After completing an intense **QA Automation program** at **SoftUni**,I’ve gained hands-on experience in manual testing 📝, Selenium WebDriver 🧑‍💻, Postman 📬, JMeter 🚀, and CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, and I’m constantly improving my skills in these areas.! Ready to catch all those pesky bugs 🐞 and squash them!

## 🧠 A Day in the Life of a QA Engineer
As a Junior QA Engineer, my day involves writing test cases 📝, running manual and automated tests 🤖, and continuously improving my skills to ensure software quality. I’m still learning, but I focus on catching potential issues early and making sure the software performs as expected. 🌟
And of course, I’m always on the lookout for bugs 🐞 — they don’t stand a chance!
