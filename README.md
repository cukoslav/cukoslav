## 🧠 A Day in the Life of a QA Engineer
As a Junior QA Engineer, my day involves writing test cases 📝, running manual and automated tests 🤖, and continuously improving my skills to ensure software quality. I’m still learning, but I focus on catching potential issues early and making sure the software performs as expected. 🌟
And of course, I’m always on the lookout for bugs 🐞 — they don’t stand a chance!
